Absolutely. Below is a fully integrated prompt that will:
	1.	Create the RhymePad feature with all required functionality
	2.	Include a mock lesson that automatically saves an entry into the user’s vault
	3.	Maintain visual and UX consistency with the rest of the app

Full Prompt for Replit AI Agent: RhymePad + Mock Lesson Integration

⸻

Let’s build a new feature called RhymePad and connect it to a mock lesson to demonstrate auto-saving learning content.

⸻

Part 1: Add the RhymePad Feature

Create a new component: RhymePad.tsx

It should include:
	•	A list of all saved RhymePad entries
	•	A “+ Add Entry” button that opens a modal or form with:
	•	content: Text input
	•	tags: Comma-separated (e.g., “filler, 2-syllable”)
	•	isFavorite: Toggle
	•	Each entry displays:
	•	Content
	•	Tags
	•	Star (toggle favorite)
	•	Trash icon (delete)
	•	Timestamp (formatted)

Data Model:

type RhymePadEntry = {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  addedFrom: 'manual' | 'lesson' | 'freestyle';
  lessonId?: string;
  dateCreated: string;
  isFavorite: boolean;
};

Store this array as userRhymePad in localStorage or user context.

Build a useRhymePad() hook that allows:
	•	addEntry(entry: RhymePadEntry)
	•	deleteEntry(id: string)
	•	toggleFavorite(id: string)
	•	getAllEntries(): RhymePadEntry[]

Navigation:
	•	Add a new “RhymePad” icon in the bottom nav bar
	•	Label: My Flow Vault

⸻

Part 2: Connect to a Mock Lesson

In the Intro to Rhymes lesson (or create a Filler Phrases 101 lesson), add this interaction:

Exercise Type: info_card

{
  type: "info_card",
  question: "Filler Phrase of the Day",
  content: "You already know",
  afterComplete: () => {
    // On tap, auto-add this to RhymePad
    addEntry({
      id: uuid(),
      content: "You already know",
      tags: ["filler", "confidence"],
      addedFrom: "lesson",
      lessonId: "filler-phrases-101",
      dateCreated: new Date().toISOString(),
      isFavorite: false
    });
  }
}

Display a toast or animation when this is saved: “Added to your Flow Vault!”

⸻

Design Notes:
	•	Make the RhymePad visual, bold, and hip-hop friendly.
	•	Think of it like a digital notepad crossed with a songbook.

Let me know once this is built — then we’ll wire it up to Freestyle Practice Mode and XP bonuses.

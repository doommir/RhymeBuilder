We’re now expanding the Practice Phase into a full freestyle training experience.

---

## OVERVIEW

### Users should be able to:

1. **Choose a beat from a beat library**
2. **See a random word generator that updates during freestyle**
3. **Freestyle over beat**
4. **Transcribe with Whisper**
5. **Tap lines to save to Flow Vault**

---

## PART 1: Beat Library & Selection

### Create a new JSON file with 5–10 beats:

```ts
type Beat = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  bpm: number;
  vibe: string; // e.g. “laid-back”, “battle”, “upbeat”
  fileUrl: string;
};

const beats: Beat[] = [
  { id: "battle-bounce", title: "Battle Bounce", bpm: 90, vibe: "battle", fileUrl: "/beats/battle-bounce.mp3" },
  { id: "lofi-flow", title: "Lofi Flow", bpm: 80, vibe: "laid-back", fileUrl: "/beats/lofi-flow.mp3" },
  { id: "trap-snap", title: "Trap Snap", bpm: 140, vibe: "hype", fileUrl: "/beats/trap-snap.mp3" },
  ...
];
```

### UI:

- Add a **Beat Selection Modal** before practice starts
- Show beat title, BPM, and vibe
- Button: “Preview” and “Choose This Beat”
- After user selects a beat → begin session

---

## PART 2: Random Word Generator

### Features:

- Display a large word in the top corner of the freestyle screen
- Every **8–10 seconds**, the word updates
- Words should be relevant to rap vocabulary (nouns, actions, emotions)

Example:
```ts
const words = ["dream", "mirror", "elevate", "flex", "truth", "shadow", "ignite"];
```

- Use `setInterval()` to update the word during the session
- Optional toggle: “Show Words” or “Freestyle Freely”

---

## PART 3: Freestyle + Transcription (Already in progress)

Ensure the following:

- Selected beat plays in background
- Microphone starts recording on tap
- Whisper transcribes user audio
- Display lines in real-time
- Let user tap any line → “Save to Flow Vault”

---

## Summary Screen

At the end of session:

- Show beat name
- Show transcription
- Show any saved lines
- XP earned
- Button: “Retry with new words” or “Try a new beat”

---

This will make the practice experience feel guided, interactive, and endlessly replayable.

Let me know when this is ready — next we can add **practice goals**, **“ghost rapper” AI duels**, or **live bar scoring**.

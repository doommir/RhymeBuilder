We are upgrading our lesson format to support multi-phase learning inside each lesson. Each lesson will now include 5 components:

## NEW LESSON FLOW FORMAT

Each lesson should follow this structure:

1. **Reading Phase**
   - Display short explanatory text (`readingText`)

2. **Video Phase**
   - Embed a YouTube video from the `videoUrl`
   - Show a checklist from `observationChecklist[]`
   - Include a note-taking textarea
   - Button: “Save to Flow Vault” (tagged with `lessonId` and `note`)

3. **Practice Phase**
   - Play a beat from `practiceBeatUrl`
   - Record user’s freestyle using OpenAI’s Whisper API
   - Display transcription in real time
   - Let users tap any transcribed line → “Add to Flow Vault” (tagged with `freestyle`, `lessonId`)

4. **Recall Phase**
   - Flashcard-style review from `recallExercises[]`
   - Support types: `info_card`, `multiple_choice`, `fill_in_blank`
   - Each question awards XP

5. **Lesson Completion**
   - Show XP earned
   - Confirm any Vault entries saved
   - Offer retry option or suggest next lesson

## INITIAL LESSON MODULES

### 1. Setup & Punchline

- **readingText**: “In battle and punchline rap, setups build the context and punchlines deliver the surprise or wordplay. Most happen in 2-bar sequences.”
- **videoUrl**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sample1
- **observationChecklist**:
  - "What line sets up the punch?"
  - "Is the punch humorous or aggressive?"
- **practiceBeatUrl**: `/beats/battle-bounce.mp3`
- **recallExercises**:
  - Multiple Choice: “Which of these is a punchline?”
  - True/False: “The setup should be more clever than the punchline.”

### 2. Filler Phrases

- **readingText**: “Filler phrases are short transitions that keep your flow going when you’re thinking of your next bar. They also give space to breathe.”
- **videoUrl**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sample2
- **observationChecklist**:
  - "How often do you hear repeated phrases?"
  - "Do they fit the rhythm?"
- **practiceBeatUrl**: `/beats/laidback-loop.mp3`
- **recallExercises**:

  - Multiple Choice: “Choose the filler: ‘You know what I mean’ / ‘I spit bars like fire’ / ‘Mic check one two’”

### 3. Cadence & Flow

- **readingText**: “Cadence is your rhythmic pattern. It’s what makes your bars sound musical. Changing cadence keeps the listener engaged.”
- **videoUrl**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sample3
- **observationChecklist**:
  - "Where do they pause?"
  - "Do they ride the beat or push against it?"
- **practiceBeatUrl**: `/beats/flowy-vibes.mp3`
- **recallExercises**:
  - Info Card: “What is cadence?”
  - Multiple Choice: “Which is an example of syncopation?”

### 4. Riding the Beat

- **readingText**: “Riding the beat means aligning your words and pauses to the rhythm so that it feels natural and groovy. Some rappers glide with it, others bounce off it.”
- **videoUrl**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sample4
- **observationChecklist**:
  - "Does the rapper follow the kick or the snare?"
  - "Are syllables landing on beat or behind?"
- **practiceBeatUrl**: `/beats/boom-bap-101.mp3`
- **recallExercises**:
  - Multiple Choice: “What does it mean to ‘ride the beat’?”
  - Multiple Choice: “Which line best matches a slow beat?”

### 5. Multisyllabic Rhymes

- **readingText**: “Multisyllabic rhymes are the advanced form of rhyming multiple syllables across bars, like ‘elevation’ with ‘meditation’ or ‘hologram’ with ‘follow them’.”
- **videoUrl**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sample5
- **observationChecklist**:
  - "How many syllables are rhyming?"
  - "Do the rhymes land on the beat?"
- **practiceBeatUrl**: `/beats/technical-flow.mp3`
- **recallExercises**:
  - Multiple Choice: “Which is a multisyllabic rhyme?”
  - Fill-in-the-blank: “______ with dedication, soul elevation”

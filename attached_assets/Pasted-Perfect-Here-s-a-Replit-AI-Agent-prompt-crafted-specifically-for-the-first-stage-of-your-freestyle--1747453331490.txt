Perfect. Here’s a Replit AI Agent prompt crafted specifically for the first stage of your freestyle rap learning app. It gives Replit a clear, scoped task while allowing iterative expansion and leaves room for you (as product manager) to evaluate functionality and UX before adding complexity.

⸻

Prompt for Replit AI Agent (Stage 1 – MVP Framework)

You are a senior mobile app developer.

Your job is to help build the MVP foundation of a Duolingo-style app designed to teach and train freestyle rap through gamified microlearning.

GOAL

Start by creating a mobile-responsive web app (React + Tailwind preferred) with the following starter features:
	1.	Login screen (username only for now)
	2.	Home dashboard with:
	•	Welcome message
	•	XP bar (just a static value for now)
	•	A “Start Lesson” button
	3.	Lesson Module View that includes:
	•	Title of the lesson (e.g. “Intro to Rhymes”)
	•	Placeholder for instructions (e.g. “Match words that rhyme”)
	•	Three fake questions for demo (can be simple multiple choice)
	•	“Finish Lesson” button that routes back to dashboard and increases XP (mock logic only)
	4.	Basic routing/navigation between login, dashboard, and lessons using React Router.
	5.	Store user state in localStorage so XP and username persist on refresh.

⸻

Design Goals
	•	Must feel fun and clean (bright colors, bold text)
	•	Use placeholder data and static assets for now
	•	Prioritize modular component structure for future expansion

⸻

After this stage:

We’ll begin adding audio features (recording freestyles), AI feedback, and dynamic lesson generation — but only after the UI skeleton and gamification loop is functional.

⸻

Future Integration Targets (do not build yet):
	•	Microphone input
	•	AI scoring
	•	Beat library
	•	Adaptive learning paths
	•	Leaderboards & freestyle battles

⸻

Tone

Think: “Duolingo meets SoundCloud” — energetic, creative, and responsive.

Weâ€™ve uploaded 30 custom beats to the `FlowVaultBeat` bucket on Replit. Each beat file is named using **kebab-case** and ends in `.mp3` (e.g. `drip-code.mp3`, `mic-assassin.mp3`).

## ðŸ›  PART 1: Create the Beat Library

1. Create a new file in the project called `flowvault_beats.json`
2. Paste the following JSON inside:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "mic-assassin",
    "title": "Mic Assassin",
    "bpm": 90,
    "vibe": "battle",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/mic-assassin.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": "verbal-combat",
    "title": "Verbal Combat",
    "bpm": 90,
    "vibe": "battle",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/verbal-combat.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": "drip-code",
    "title": "Drip Code",
    "bpm": 140,
    "vibe": "trap",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/drip-code.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": "808-ambush",
    "title": "808 Ambush",
    "bpm": 140,
    "vibe": "trap",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/808-ambush.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": "midnight-scribbles",
    "title": "Midnight Scribbles",
    "bpm": 75,
    "vibe": "lofi",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/midnight-scribbles.mp3"
  },
  {
    "id": "notebook-daydream",
    "title": "Notebook Daydream",
    "bpm": 78,
    "vibe": "lofi",
    "fileUrl": "https://flowvaultbeat.replit.app/notebook-daydream.mp3"
  }
  // Add remaining 24 beats here with matching kebab-case filenames
]
```

## ðŸ›  PART 2: Use Beat Library in Practice Phase

1. Load the `flowvault_beats.json` dynamically in the app
2. Add a **Beat Selector screen** before the user starts freestyle practice
3. For each beat, show:
   - `title`
   - `bpm`
   - `vibe`
   - Preview button (plays audio)
   - Select button (loads the beat into the practice session)

4. On select:
   - Start the practice session
   - Load the selected beat into the `<audio>` player
   - Transcribe using Whisper as the user raps over it

Let me know once this is connected â€” next weâ€™ll add filtering, tags, and unlockable beat packs.

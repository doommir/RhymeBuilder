We’re now focusing on fixing and building out the **Practice Phase** of the lesson flow so that users can freestyle with a beat, transcribe their flow, and save punchlines into the Flow Vault.

---

## GOAL

Enable the following functionality inside the practice phase of the lesson:

1. **Load and play beat audio**
2. **Record user freestyle (via microphone)**
3. **Transcribe using OpenAI Whisper**
4. **Display transcript line by line**
5. **Allow users to tap a line → Save to Flow Vault**

---

## STEP-BY-STEP FUNCTIONALITY TO BUILD

### 1. Audio Beat Playback

- Accept a `practiceBeatUrl` (e.g., `/beats/battle-bounce.mp3`) from the lesson module.
- Render a play/pause button with audio controls.
- Load and stream the beat in the background of the practice session.
- Optional: Use waveform animation or countdown indicator before recording.

```tsx
<audio controls autoplay src={lesson.practiceBeatUrl}></audio>
```

If autoplay fails due to browser restrictions, allow user to manually press "Start Beat."

---

### 2. Microphone Input for Freestyle

- When beat playback starts, enable microphone recording.
- Show a "Recording..." indicator while beat plays.
- Start recording at the same time the beat starts (or user taps “Start Recording”)
- Allow up to 60 seconds for now.

Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` to capture audio.

---

### 3. Transcription using OpenAI Whisper

- Send recorded audio to OpenAI’s Whisper API for transcription.
- Transcribe to text and split it by sentence or pause for better formatting.
- Show transcription in a scrollable text area or dynamic list below the player.

---

### 4. Tap to Save Lines

- Each line should have a small [+] or bookmark icon.
- When user taps the icon, prompt: “Save this line to your Flow Vault?”
- On confirm, store the line with:
```ts
{
  content: "transcribed line",
  tags: ["freestyle", "setup-punchline"],
  lessonId: "setup-punchline",
  dateCreated: new Date().toISOString(),
  isFavorite: false
}
```

---

### 5. Summary Screen

- At the end, show:
  - Transcript summary
  - Any lines saved to vault
  - XP earned (mocked or real)
  - Button: “Retry Freestyle” or “Go to Flow Vault”

Let me know when this is complete — next we’ll add voice warmups, filler phrase assists, or live cadence feedback.

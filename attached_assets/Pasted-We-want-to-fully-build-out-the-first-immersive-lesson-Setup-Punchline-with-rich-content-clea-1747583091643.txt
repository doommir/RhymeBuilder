## PHASE 1: Reading – What You'll Learn

Replace the current short description with:

**Text:**
> One of the most important techniques in freestyle and battle rap is the setup + punchline combo.  
>  
> The **setup** creates context — it may sound ordinary, but it leads the listener down a path.  
> The **punchline** then delivers the surprise — a joke, a threat, or a clever wordplay.  
>  
> These often happen in **2-bar pairs**:  
> - **Bar 1** = Setup  
> - **Bar 2** = Punchline  
>  
> A master of this structure was **Big L**, one of Harlem’s finest.  
> He was known for setting up calm, chill lines before dropping brutal or hilarious punches.  
>  
> Example:  
> *"Ask Beavis, I get nothing but-head"*  
>  
> The listener doesn’t expect the wordplay flip until the final moment. That’s the punch.  
>  
> By learning to write with structure, you build tension — and deliver satisfaction.
